# Physics-informed neural networks

In this repository, I have collected some examples of applications of neural networks in the field of physics. These networks, called PINNs, use the networks as universal function approximators, with a loss function defined by the differential equation.

More details can be found in [this blog post](https://nchagnet.pages.dev/blog/physics-informed-neural-networks/).

These solutions are computed using the [DeepXDE](https://deepxde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package.
